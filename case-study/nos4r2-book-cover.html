                                This is an independent project to design a conceptual book cover for Joe Hill's horror novel NOS4R2. 
                                <span class="font-medium">The cover communicates the important themes of the story using visual rhetoric and serves as the base for an interactive experience connecting readers to the story.</span> 
                                Metaphor and allusion are utilized through the image of the car as the shadow to express the inability to accept reality, signifying something being haunted and not what it appears. 
                                The scrabble tiles, an in-story access to the supernatural, represents a bridge between the readers and the fictional world.

                        <p>
                            NOS4R2 (more commonly seen as NOS4A2) is a supernatural horror novel following Victoria McQueen, a woman with the supernatural ability to find missing things. 
                            After discovering her ability by riding her bike across an old covered bridge as a child, she eventually crossed path with Charles Manx, a sinister figure who uses his gift to abduct children in a 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith.

                        <p>
                            NOS4R2 blends psychological horror with dark fantasy to explore the corruption of innocence, the power of imagination, trauma and self-destruction, among other themes. 
                            I wanted to highlight those themes through the story's fantastical world and the objects that connect the characters to their abilities—Vic McQueen's bike, Charlie Manx's Rolls-Royce, and side character's scrabble tiles. 
                            The imaginary amusement park Christmasland is an important location and opens up more possibilities for visual elements.

                        <h3>Brainstorm sketches</h3>
                        <p>Initial ideas were sketched on paper for quick explorations. I focused on experimenting with the imageries and themes, then moved onto typography and layout choices.</p>

                        The sketches featuring the characters and their shadows seemed more interesting and suitable for the story. 
                        I explored different placements and angles, and also made simpler sketches focusing on straightforward imageries and typography.
                    </p>

                        The final stage of paper sketches was exploring different layouts. 
                        I chose the concepts of the simpler handprint and the character on her bike with the car as her shadow, and redrew them in axial, concentric, and radial layouts.

                        <p>
                            The concept with the character is more distinctive and conveys the story better compared to the handprint. 
                            Axial layouts were more appropriate and the least complicated to transition to digital design and refine further.

                        <p>I experimented with colours and stylistic directions. Based on the story, I wanted the design to have a comic book feel.</p>
                        <p>The art style and colour scheme were inspired by the animated movie ”Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”, the comic book series ”Sin City” by Frank Miller, and ”Hellboy” by Mike Mignolia.</p>

                        Based on feedback, I switched out the initial blood-like title with the scrabble tiles which have a stronger connection to the story. 
                        The direction of the back cover text was aligned to the diagonal direction of the front cover illustration.

                            In the story, scrabble tiles connect an individual to their supernatural world. 
                            To mirror that, in this experience, the tiles act as a bridge between the readers and the fictional world of the novel. 
                            The audience is first presented with the cover with scrabble tiles placed on it. 
                            By moving closer, the cover disappears to reveal a different set of tiles inside the book, prompting the audience to come closer and investigate to put together the message.

                        <p>
                            While the first iteration was completed in 2022, I wanted to adjust some details I was not entirely happy with and I decided to make another iteration a year later. 
                            I like the first iteration—it has an interesting concept and layout. 
                            I was learning more about vector illustrations and wanted to redo the character illustration. 
                            I revisited this cover design once again at the start of 2025.

                            I used the same sketch as the foundation and maintained the overall layout. 
                            The illustrations for the main character and the car were drawn closer to their references. 
                            They have less of a comic book art style, but extend across the cover in a subtler manner.

                            Looking back at both iterations, the first iteration has a more distinctive colour scheme that better ties to the story. 
                            I wanted to experiment with the first colour scheme again but adjust it to be closer to the colours of the digital sketches.

                        <p>
                            Being able to take one of my favourite stories, explore my creativity, and visualize my interpretation of a core theme was a great experience. 
                            To make this happen, I learned about design layouts and different ways to organize imageries and text. 
                            I enjoyed sketching and turning one of these ideas into a refined cover.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Looking back at my entire process, I should have done more exploration of colours and styles. 
                            The time allotted for the first iteration was four weeks and I had other projects running concurrently, so I had quickly chosen a colour palette and went with it. 
                            I still really like the first cover, despite a few small details that I wanted to adjust after learning more about design. 
                            However, had I done more explorations and experimentations, I could have made a cover that I was happier with the first time around.
