                                YouTube's features that were initially designed for users convenience have made it easier for the platform to maximize watch time and engagement, while raising concerns about digital well-being. 
                                <span class="font-medium">There are opportunities to redesign the YouTube platform and interface to better accounts for users' well-being.</span> 
                                I reimagined the viewing experience to encourage more intentional actions and remind users to take breaks, with little intrusion on their experience.

                                <h3>YouTube is designed to keep users on the platform</h3>
                                
                                <p>
                                    By encouraging and recommending sensational and attention-grabbing content in combination with autoplay and queuing features, YouTube facilitates binge-watching and increases watch time. 
                                    It generates more revenue at the expense of producing misleading content, fragmenting users' attention, and potentially causing screen addiction.
                                </p>
            
                                <p>Although YouTube has introduced break reminder and watch time report to encourage more control of personal usage, these features are limited and can't effectively counter the platform's primary goal of keeping users watching.</p>
            
                                <p class="hmw">“How might we redesign YouTube interface to reduce distractions and encourage mindful usage with minimal intrusion on the user's experience?”</p>

                        <h3>Redesigned Home feed for intentional usage</h3>
                        <p>
                            This redesigned Home feed puts more focus on the search bar and encourages more active query for content. 
                            Users are shown a finite number of content at a time and can actively load more videos. 
                            User testing found that users were not bothered by the redesigns and additional workload when looking for content on their Home feed.

                            They are not intrusive to test participants and help them be more mindful when using the platform.

                        <p>
                            YouTube is a global social platform and crowd-sourced video library. 
                            It has gone through constant changes with its interface, services, and guidelines—going from a simple video sharing site to incorporating content streaming, social engagement, and monetization opportunities for creatives and companies.

                        <p>
                            The primary parties of YouTube's digital ecosystem are the <span class="font-medium">creators</span>, the <span class="font-medium">viewers</span>, and the <span class="font-medium">advertisers</span>. 
                            Creators upload content for viewers to access. Brands pay YouTube to display their advertisements and partner with creators to promote their products. 
                            This revenue ensures free and accessible content for viewers and compensation for creators. 
                            As the platform hosting these activities, YouTube monitors and regulates them, and ensures all parties adhere to its guidelines and are satisfied (Eves).

                        <p>
                            Revenue is generated through advertisements shown on the platform. 
                            This is a part of YouTube's Freemium experience. 
                            Most of its content and features are available to the general public at no cost, in exchange for ad placements on the content they access. 
                            YouTube offers subscriptions for an undisrupted experience, offline viewing, and access to exclusive content.

                            YouTube's algorithm favours content that can generate more engagement and watch time. 
                            Creators are encouraged to make advertiser-friendly videos and garner as many views as they can while avoiding demonetization.

                            The algorithm, autoplay, and queue aim to keep viewers on the platform for as long as possible. 
                            The algorithm pushes content that interests the viewer based on their watch and search history. 
                            The autoplay feature automatically starts the next suggested video once the current one ends, and the queue allows viewers to create a temporary playlist of videos that will autoplay.

                        Creators are encouraged to design their thumbnails and titles to be as eye-catching as possible to generate more revenue. 
                        These videos distract viewers, grab their attention, keep them on the platform, and are favoured by the algorithm and pushed to the forefront of viewers' feed.

                        The constant stream of content keeps viewers on the platform and increases watch time and revenue for YouTube, but at the expense of fragmenting viewers' attention and unnecessary high social media usage. 
                        Prolonged watch time can contribute to screen addiction, reduced attention span, and mental health concerns, especially among young viewers.

                        <p>
                            I interviewed and observed how the people around me use YouTube. 
                            There isn't a significant shift in how different age groups use YouTube. 
                            The differences in the type of content is unavoidable as people's interests naturally change as they grow older.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            The most interesting information I gathered from interviews and observations is the occurrence of people playing something in the background while they work or engage in other activities. 
                            It's not an occurrence exclusive to YouTube, but YouTube is one of the more convenient tools to fill in the silence.

                            It's difficult to significantly change how the platform works without impacting its revenue or harming the user experience, especially without more in-depth business understanding. 
                            However, there are smaller changes that can reduce distractions on the platform and encourage users to manage their screen time:

                        With over 2.7 billion active users worldwide, YouTube still benefits if some of them spend less time on the platform. 
                        Its entertainment and education values, in addition to the long-standing brand name, are competitive factors that emerging platforms cannot benefit from.

                        The additional space around the search bar was initially intended for large advertisement banners since its prominence could be beneficial for revenue—this revenue could be enough to make the case for removing mid-roll and non-skippable ads, improving the viewing experience. 
                        I mocked up three advertisement experiences for user testing: (1) works more cohesively with the search bar, (2) is larger and more invasive, (3) removes the advertisement completely.

                            User testing found that the placement of the timer is noticeable enough and does not cause much mental drain. 
                            Participants found this feature helpful and weren't aware of its existence in the app.

                            Test participants suggested allowing users to set their own interval for the “long usage” popups, incorporating graphics and more engaging visual elements, and trying to reduce its repetitiveness.

                            YouTube's crackdown on ad blockers started in 2023 and by summer of 2024, it has set up a three-strike system globally to deter the use of ad blockers. 
                            In addition to the crackdown, ads have been appearing more frequently. 
                            While these tactics may have succeeded in pushing the viewers who rely on the platform to pay up, they also pushed the rest away.

                            As short-form content became more popular, YouTube began offering Shorts to compete with Instagram reels, TikTok videos, and similar short-form content. 
                            This has been changing the way creators and viewers interact with the platform.

                        My personal experience affected much of the initial exploration. 
                        Through secondary research and user interviews, I discovered features and platform behaviours I did not know about, which is also a common observation among the people I talked to. 
                        This might indicate that the overwhelming number of features are not organized properly to inform users of their existence and functions. 
                        This doesn't necessarily mean that the platform is badly designed—there are constant changes to improve the user experience and it's difficult to add features without drastically redesigning the platform.

                        Identifying a direction to encourage users to stop using the platform momentarily while still ensure revenue generation was a challenge.
